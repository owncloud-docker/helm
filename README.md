## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started. Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add owncloud https://owncloud-docker.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo owncloud` to see the charts. The Chart documentation is available in the [owncloud directory](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/owncloud/README.md).
